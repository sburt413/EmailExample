# Email Example

This repository contain a small Java project used as a coding assessment.

The goal is to evaluate a candidate's ability to reason through problems, identify logical errors, write effective unit tests, and improve code maintainability.

The project centers around the `EmailService` class, which contains both incomplete test coverage and intentional issues that require correction.

## Rules

1) Use of AI, including generative AI, is encouraged
2) Take full advantage of your IDE and its features
3) Google, Stack Overflow, and other such resources may be used

When using outside resources, please document the prompts and queries used.

Candidate are encouraged to ask any questions they feel are relevant during the course of the assessment.  They are strongly encouraged to explain their reasoning throughout the assessment.

## Tasks

Provide test coverage for the `EmailService` class.  Initial work has been started in `EmailServiceTest`.

The codebase contains multiple logical errors and several areas that can benefit from refactoring.

## Assessment

Success will be evaluated holistically based on the following criteria:

- Quality of candidates reasoning, including the questions asked
- Depth and clarity of test coverage added
- Efficient usage of the allotted time
- Identification and correction of logical errors
- Improving to code clarity, comprehensibility and maintainability
